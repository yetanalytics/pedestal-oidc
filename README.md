This lib provides a [pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) interceptor for working with [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) tokens.

## Usage

See [the demo](src/dev/com/yetanalytics/pedestal_oidc/service.clj) for a simple example of usage.

### Interceptor

Give `com.yetanalytics.pedestal-oidc.interceptor/decode-interceptor` a function that returns a map of JWKS key IDs to the keys themselves and place it in your interceptor chain. Decoded claims will be placed on the request at `:com.yetanalytics.pedestal-oidc/claims`.

### Getting Keysets

`com.yetanalytics.pedestal-oidc.jwt/get-keyset` will attempt to fetch a valid keyset from the given `jwks-uri`. How this is stored/cached is up to the lib consumer.

### Discovery Utils

`com.yetanalytics.pedestal-oidc.discovery` provides facilities for pulling config metadata (like the `jwks_uri`) from the IDP per [the spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig).

## Development

To run a demo instance of keycloak:

    make keycloak-demo

This will host a JWKS uri of http://0.0.0.0:8080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/certs with the realm's public keyset.

You can then run the demo API:

    make run-dev

## Testing

Run the test suite:

    make test
